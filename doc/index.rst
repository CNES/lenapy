Welcome to lenapy's documentation!
==================================

**Lenapy** is a python library based on xarray with several modules:

* lenapy_ocean: encapsulation of the GSW library containing the main ocean thermodynamic calculation routines (TEOS10)
* lenapy_geo: current operations on gridded data (longitude/latitude/depth)
* lenapy_time: common operations on time series (filtering, climatology, regressions, etc.)
* lenapy_harmo: operations related to spherical harmonics decomposition and their projections on latitude/longitude grids

This library is based on the principle of class extension, i.e. functions can be applied directly to Datasets or DataArrays, by adding the extension of the module concerned and the name of the method. Ex: ds.lntime.filter(...), ds.lngeo.mean(...), de.lnocean.gohc, etc.

Reading interfaces are implemented, enabling netcdf files to be opened with a compatible formalism from the **lenapy** library.
